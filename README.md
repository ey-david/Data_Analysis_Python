# Data_Analysis_Python--Instacart

This is the scripts and deliverables of a project from the CareerFoundry data analysis training using Python to wrangle, clean, and transform data as well as visualize insights.

The objective is to uncover information about the online grocery service Instacart's sales patterns. This involved an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

The key questions included:

-What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day? This is to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
-Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money? This might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
-As Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags, marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
-Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
-The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
--What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
--Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
--Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
--Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
--What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
--What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
